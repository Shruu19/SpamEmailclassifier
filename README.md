# Spam Email Classifier ðŸ“§

This project is a simple machine learning classifier that detects whether an email is **Spam** or **Not Spam** using NLP techniques and algorithms.

## ðŸ”§ Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas
- Scikit-learn
- CountVectorizer
- Naive Bayes Classifier
- Jupyter Notebook

## ðŸ“‚ Dataset
The dataset used is `spam.csv` which contains messages labeled as spam or ham (not spam).

## ðŸ§  Model
The model is trained using the **Multinomial Naive Bayes** algorithm, which is effective for text classification tasks.

## âœ… Output
The model achieves around **95â€“98% accuracy** on the test data, making it reliable for spam filtering.

## ðŸ“Œ How to Run
1. Clone the repository
2. Open the Jupyter Notebook
3. Run all the cells to train and test the model
